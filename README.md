# Homework 06: Data wrangling wrap up

This is the repository for STAT547 HW 06 which focuses on data wrangling skills.

There are two parts to my assignment:

1) Character data

I chose to read and work on some of the exercises in the [Strings chapter of R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/strings.html)

2) Writing functions

As the base for this section, I chose to write one or more functions to do something useful to the Gapminder data.
I made it something I canâ€™t easily do with built-in functions (ie. something not trivial to do with the simple dplyr verbs).
I used the linear regression function presented [here](http://stat545.com/block012_function-regress-lifeexp-on-year.html) as my starting point.
